# SAI 2.0

## Overview of Submission Structure

### Reason for Development
This project is a 2020 capstone project that addressed the current issues with the UWF students assessment.
The reason this software was created was to solve one very important issue with the SAI, most of the questions were binary or told the teacher very little about their performance.
With this improved SAI it would take meaningful responses from the students rather than a multiple choice test.
